# code-wars-v4
Hi everyone! This is where we'll be storing all our code on this project. Some basic guidelines:
- Always pull into your local machine before you start to work, so that you are working on the latest version of the code.
- Make sure your commit messages are descriptive, such as ADDED: `xyz` function in `my_script,py`
- Most importantly, ALWAYS create a new branch when you're adding something new, because if it is buggy it could break everything.
- Ensure you test thoroughly before pushing onto GitHub. Never push buggy code.
